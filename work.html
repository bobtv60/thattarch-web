          Cashier & Cook Ordering System - 2024
        </p>

        <p class="feature-description">
          This is your typical ordering system found at most roleplay games, so it was quite simple to code. On  the cashier side of the system, the user selects items (food or drink) to add to the customer's order which is then submitted to be made. The chef side of the system requires the user to hold out tools and confirm them to be in the list of items on the order before they can deliver it to the customer.

          Intelligent Discord Support Bot - 2023/2024

        <p class="feature-description">
          I built this custom discord bot from scratch using Javascript. The user DMs the support bot a question or issue they have, the bot searches the message for keywords and compares it to answers in a knowledgebase. The bot returns a reply and if the user isn't happy, they have the option to open a conversation with a real staff member and talk through the bot.

          I made this for a roblox roleplay group also, and it's pretty neat in my opinion. There are lots of different modes and features to try.

          Activity Tracking System - 2024

        <p class="feature-description">
          This is a system I made which combines discord and roblox by taking command input from a discord bot, and sending it through my API over to roblox. In the video, I demonstrate starting a "shift" of activity and ending it so that it is recorded in a database which can be accessed at any time through other bot commands.
