              I'm experienced with a number of programming languages, and have some experience in designing UI although it is not my primary focus. You can view my past work on this same website <a href="work">here</a>. I've been coding for 2 years.

            <p class="feature-description">
              I work for a very small amount compared to other developers who charge more, as I'm passionate about the work I do. I also work for free sometimes, it all depends on the project or commission but I can always guarantee a very low price.

              Despite cheap prices, my work is kept to a high standard that you would typically expect from any developer. My code is always organized and easy to read so that you or other developers working on the same project can see what the function of the script is.

            <p class="feature-description">
              I will always communicate regularly with you or other people involved in the development so that we're all on the same page and can understand how progress is coming along. I regularly check and respond to all Discord DMs I get and my response times are usually relatively quick.
